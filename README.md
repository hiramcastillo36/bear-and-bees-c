Multiple Producers and One Consumer using Semaphores

There are N bees and a hungry bear who share a jar of honey. Initially, the jar is empty, and its capacity is M portions of honey. The bear sleeps until the honey jar is full, then it eats all the honey and goes back to sleep. Each bee produces one portion of honey, placing it in the jar. The bee that fills the honey jar wakes up the bear. The goal is to write a program that synchronizes the bees and the bear. It's important to note that the values of N and M are random numbers, and each bee is uniquely identified by a number. The honey production is infinite, and the program should continue running indefinitely.
